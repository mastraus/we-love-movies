# We Love Movies!
A Thinkful backend capstone project assessing our ability to set up a database and routes so users can access data about movies, theaters, and reviews. You can view the live deployed version of the app [here](https://astraus-movies-client.herokuapp.com/).

## Project Setup
1. Download files to your computer.
2. In your code editor, open up a terminal. Split the terminal into two.
3. In one terminal, change directory into the client by running:
```bash
 cd client
 ```
4. Run the following command in the client terminal:
```bash
npm start
```
5. In the next terminal, change directory into the server by running:
```bash
cd server
```
6. Run the following command in the server terminal:
```bash
npm start
```

## Capstone Learning Outcomes
Through this capstone, I strengthened:
1. Receiving requests through routes
2. Running tests through the command line
3. Accessing information through route and query parameters
4. Creating error handlers
5. Building a RESTful API
6. Creating a connection to my databse with knex
7. Writing database queries to make CRUD routes in Express server
8. Writing database migrations
9. Deploying the full-stack application to a cloud service
